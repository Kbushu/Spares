# Introduction

This is an assignment for the Dynamic Data Projects Course.  

The purpose is to build a shiny app with supporting documentation.

The application is a spares calculator that determine quantity based on Poisson distribution.  The Shiny app allows a user to input parameters using sliders and from that can determine the probability of having enough items in stock.

## Operation

The user can input:

- Number of items in operation

- Failure rate

- Reorder intervals

The calculator will provide immediate feedback and calculate a recommeded quantity based on a target service level.

#Files

The _Spares_ folder hosts the Shiny app files.

The _docs_ folder hosts the Slides, built using RStudio presenter.
